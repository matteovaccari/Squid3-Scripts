# Squid3-Scripts
Somme funny scripts, such as:


-googleSearch.pl : modify other people's google search queries

-asciiBlower.pl : converts other people's images into ascii "art" (you'll have to change $ourIP var to your LAN ip)


Note: you'll need ImageMagick, Ghostscript and jp2a to make them work, just do :

sudo apt-get -y install imagemagick ghostscript jp2a
